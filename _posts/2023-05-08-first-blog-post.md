First day as an apprentice at Clean Coders. My first task was to set up this website and write this blog entry.
I'm very excited to see what new experiences and opportunities I will come across during my apprenticeship. My next
task will be to complete some [Clojure Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans) to familiarize myself
more with the language.
