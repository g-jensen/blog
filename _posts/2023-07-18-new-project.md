Today I had my Iteration Planning Meeting, which means I showed my mentor everything that I did the previous
week. I also get my new assignment for the current week. For this week, I was allowed to choose a project (to make in Java)
that met the following criteria:
* Multiple classes
* Inheritance
* Polymophism
* At least 3 design patterns
* Tests for everything

The first three criteria are pretty much encapsulated by the fourth criterion, and tests are implied at this point,
so the only real requirement is that it has three design patterns. I was given some options, but I ultimately
chose to go my own path and decided to make a simple math language. The language will support basic
operations like addition and subtraction. It will also include math functions like `exp` and `ln`. Additionally, it will
be possible to create constant symbols to store a value (e.g. `A = 5`). While not allowing the user to create custom
functions, it will support some built-in higher-order functions. All of this will be done in a REPL style environment.
