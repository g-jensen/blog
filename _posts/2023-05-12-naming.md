The names you give to classes, functions, and variables while programming is
vital to a smooth experience, especially when collaborating with others.

Common practices differ among languages, but some general principles to consider when naming things in your code are as follows:

* Reveal your intent
  * If you have to read the code to understand a name, you have failed to
    reveal your intent
* Parts of speech
  * While exceptions can be made, following these rules generally results
    in easy to read code
  * Class -> Noun
  * Variable -> Noun
  * Methods
    * Returns boolean -> Predicate (e.g. `isEven`)
    * Returns non-boolean -> Verb
  * Enum -> Often Adjectives
* The Scope Length Rule
  * Variables
    * The longer the scope of the variable, the longer the name of the variable
    * Variables in short scope should have short names
  * Classes/Functions
    * The longer the scope, the shorter the name
    * The shorter the scope, the longer the name

Note that in Clojure, functions that return booleans are usually named with
a question mark at the end like `even?`
