For my traveling salesman kata, I'm making a UI to be able to easily pick points and visualize
the algorithm.

I chose the Quil graphics library which works really well and is very simplistic. All I had to do is add Quil as a dependency and add the following code with `q` as the namespace for Quil:
```clojure
(defn setup []
  (q/frame-rate 10)
  (q/background 200))

(defn draw []
  (q/clear)
  (q/ellipse 200 150 10 10))

(q/defsketch example
  :title "Quil Example"
  :settings #(q/smooth 2)
  :setup setup
  :draw draw
  :size [400 300])
```

The `setup` function is called once at the beginning of the program. `draw` is called every frame
(at 10 frames per second as defined in the `setup` function). Right now it just draws a circle of radius 10 in the middle of the window. Finally, the `defsketch` defines attributes of the window like size and title.
