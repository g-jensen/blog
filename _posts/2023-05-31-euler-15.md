[Project Euler #15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15) asks: How many distinct Lattice Paths in a 20x20 grid from
the top left to the bottom right are there?

The example they show is of a 2x2 grid, which has 6 distinct paths.

To solve this, one might try to walk through every possible path and keep track of the number of paths counted.

But there is actually a pretty simple formula for the calculation asked for in the problem.

If we label the different possible directions a, b, c, and d, it is a little easier to see.

We want to know the different ways that we can arrange a, b, c, and d. Which is just the permutations. So the formula
must be `(2n)!` right?

Almost. We actually double-count a lot while going through the permutations of [a b c d]. For example, the permutation
[a b c d] is the same as [a b d c] because `c` and `d` both go to the right.

So we really want all the permutations of [a b c d] where `a` comes before `b` and `c` comes before `d`. To do
this, we must divide by `(n!)^2` (one `n!` for the `a-b` rule and one for the `c-d` rule).
