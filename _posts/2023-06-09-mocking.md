title: "Stubs in Speclj"

When testing the user interface of a program, one can use stubs to redefine user input to be predetermined.

For testing in Clojure, I use [Speclj](https://github.com/slagyr/speclj) which allows me to create and 
test stubs like so:

Add `(with-stubs)` before using stubs to make sure stub recoding is bound.
```clojure
(with-stubs)
```

Then use `(with-redefs)` to redefine a function to evaluate to whatever you want to simulate the user
input to be.
```clojure
(with-redefs [read-line (stub :read-line {:return "1"})]
  (should= 0 (get-user-move))
  (should-have-invoked :read-line))
```
In this case, I redefine the `read-line` function to evaluate to "1".

Notice that after the test, I add `(should-have-invoked :read-line)`, which just tests if the
stub actually worked.
