The problem description of [Project Euler #7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) is very simple and the minimum amount
of work needed to just get the solution is not that much. The problem asks:

```What is the 10,001st prime?```

# Initial Solution

My initial solution, although a bit naive, gets the job done relatively quickly for the small case:
```clojure
(defn primes [n]
  (loop [m 2 primes []]
    (if (>= (count primes) n)
      primes
      (if (every? #(not= 0 (mod m %)) primes)
        (recur (inc m) (conj primes m))
        (recur (inc m) primes)))))

(defn euler-7 [n]
  (last (primes n)))
```
```clojure
(time (euler-7 10001))  ;"Elapsed time: 1275.52175 msecs"
                        ;=> 104743
(time (euler-7 100001)) ;"Elapsed time: 78250.286791 msecs"
                        ;=> 1299721
```
The idea of the `primes` function being to calculate the first n primes by using the primes that have already
been calculated.

While this solution works, there is a lot to improve. Especially regarding time complexity.

# Structure

One thing to do to enhance the structure of this code would be to remove the need for parameters in `primes` by returning
an infinite `lazy-seq` of primes. A direct conversion looks something like this:
```clojure
(defn lazy-primes
  ([] (lazy-primes 2 []))
  ([m primes] (if (every? #(not= 0 (mod m %)) primes)
                (cons m (lazy-seq (lazy-primes (inc m) (conj primes m))))
                (lazy-primes (inc m) primes))))
```
This way our `euler-7` function looks like:
```clojure
(defn euler-7 [n]
  (nth (lazy-primes) (dec n)))
```
```clojure
(time (euler-7 10001))  ;"Elapsed time: 904.616083 msecs"
                        ;=> 104743
(time (euler-7 100001)) ;"Elapsed time: 101634.307375 msecs"
                        ;=> 1299721
```
A lot cleaner. A pinch faster for the small case. A lot slower for the big case.
# Speed
An easy way to greatly increase the speed of the `lazy-primes` function is to replace the
`(every? #(not= 0 (mod m %)) primes)` with a better way to check if a number is prime. One such way is this
`prime?` function:
```clojure
(defn prime? [n]
  (cond
    (<= n 1) false
    (= n 2) true
    :else (every? #(not= 0 (mod n %)) (range 2 (inc (Math/sqrt n))))))
```
So `lazy-primes` looks like this:
```clojure
(defn lazy-primes
  ([] (lazy-primes 2 []))
  ([m primes] (if (prime? m)
                (cons m (lazy-seq (lazy-primes (inc m) (conj primes m))))
                (lazy-primes (inc m) primes))))
```
And performance looks like this:
```clojure
(time (euler-7 10001))  ;"Elapsed time: 125.203 msecs"
                        ;=> 104743
(time (euler-7 100001)) ;"Elapsed time: 3076.132458 msecs"
                        ;=> 1299721
```
Much better. Especially for the big case.

Adding some more optimizations to the `prime?` function like so:
```clojure
(defn prime? [n]
  (cond
    (<= n 1) false
    (<= n 3) true
    (zero? (mod n 2)) false
    (zero? (mod n 3)) false
    :else (every? #(and (not= 0 (mod n %))
                        (not= 0 (mod n (+ 2 %))))
                  (range 5 (inc (Math/sqrt n)) 6))))
```
Yields a respectable runtime:
```clojure
(time (euler-7 10001))  ;"Elapsed time: 52.351334 msecs"
                        ;=> 104743
(time (euler-7 100001)) ;"Elapsed time: 787.097375 msecs"
                        ;=> 1299721
```
