title: "Clojure nth vs get"

`nth` and `get` look almost identical on the surface. They both get the nth element in a sequence.
```clojure
(nth [1 3 5] 2) ;=> 5
(get [1 3 5] 2) ;=> 5
```
But there are a couple nuances that differentiate them.

One difference is the way that they handle out-of-bounds cases.
```clojure
(nth [1 3 5] 3) ;=> IndexOutOfBoundsException
(get [1 3 5] 3) ;=> nil
```
`nth` can still handle out-of-bounds cases with a `not-found` argument.
```clojure
(nth [1 3 5] 3 "Hello") ;=> "Hello"
```
The upside to `get` is that it works with maps, while `nth` does not.
```clojure
(get {:a 1 :b 2} :b) ;=> 2
```
